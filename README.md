> My project/resume website made in React

# My Personal Wesbite
I wanted somewhere I could host my resume and projects, while being able to concisely give details on each of them.

# Running it yourself
After downloading the project, install the dependencies with 
`
npm install .
`

You can live preview the site and changes you make by running it in dev mode with `npm run dev`.
